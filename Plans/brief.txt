A web app that will generate random prompts for media students to use as inspiration for creating short films. The lecturer has created a google sheet containing a list of prompts that are to be used. A prompt should be shown to the user when they interact with a "generate idea" input. A user can choose to "save" a prompt they like, or re-generate for a new prompt. All "saved" prompts should be rendered separate to, and at the same time as, the currently generated prompt. A user can easily copy the text of their saved prompts to use in their own documentation.
